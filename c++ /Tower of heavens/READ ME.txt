THE FOLLOWING GAME WAS CREATED USING THE SFML GRAPHICS LIBRARY,
AND CODE BLOCKS ON LINUX ENVIROMENT

I would like to clarify that not all the code is mine

for the rain class and animation class i used a reference code 
i found on youtube,

CODE FOR THE RAIN:

CODE FOR ANIMATION:

the rest of the code was writen by me. 

also i used art from the following website

feel free to use them.

CONTROLS:

left and right arrows for movement

spacebar to jump

esc key to quit the game.



CONCLUSION:

the porpuse of this project was to demonsrate the use of c++
by making a game. 

i decided to use the sfml library in order to build the game faster
rather than using the console graphics.

i demonstrate how you can use arrays and loops in order to save some code typing.
even tho i didn't use more for loops to fix some arrays but time was getting short.

originally i was gonna use seperate header files and cpp files so it would look cleaner and short.

but i had to discard the idea because i created an imaginary deadline in order to challenge myself 
into simulating a real time release date. 

i also had to cut cornesrs with a few global variables, and just leaving on the 
same directory. so the porgram will run sucessfully as long as everything it's left alone
