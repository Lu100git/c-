the following program was made to run on linux 

the goal of this project was simply to make a fucntion that converts sentences into a revesed text sentence

the first challenge was to  make it into a terminal user friendly instead of going straight forward into 
typing random text, 

the second challenge was to limit the program to acept input only from text and spaces 

i fixed it by using the size standar fucntion a boolean and a loop 

in order to prevent the user from typing anything else but letters and  spaces 

the third challenge was with the user input. 

i struggled to used regular input and i had to rely on gecth fucntion.

since gecth is not present on the linux enviroment  i pulled a reference fucntion 
that recreates the gecth function on linux.

so everything turned good in the end,

the limit input was only ment to expand further the program, and it's not really nescesary, 

this is why i comented it.
