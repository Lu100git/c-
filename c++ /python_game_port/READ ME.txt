this program is meant to replicate my final project game in python

since i used the SFML library i had to use different aproaches 

and i could've save myself some coding with arrays and sprites from the SFML library.

the goal was to demonstrate that i could port my python game into c++.
and using a single class instead of hereting from 3 different classes,
since i had some issues with the original constructor,
