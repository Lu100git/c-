this project was just a simple game to demonstrate the usage of the console graphics,using c++

it was focus manly on simplicity and performance 

i skiped classes since the usage of gotoxy missplaces it glitches the colors 
and the characters as well,

also increasing the speed on the enemies causes glitches, and also the bullet increas speed
has collition detection issues, due to the limitation of the terminal, i can see this game can improve,

but i didn't wanted to make the code bigger and more complex in order to provide examples on how 
simple graphics can be added to a c++ program without graphic libraries,

also, i excluded the ncurses library in order to make this code run almost anywere 
without installing more libraries.
