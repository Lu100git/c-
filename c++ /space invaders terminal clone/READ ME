The following program it's targeted towards a linux terminal envoriment, 

it might comiple on online compilers,
but if you want to compile it on windows, just get rid of the getch builder libraries, and fucntion builds outisde of main, 
and replace the gotoxy build fucntion with windows gotoxy, also it might not compile on the system funtion,
you are just gonna have to rename the command sleep inside of system, it pauses the comandline by the amount of seconds
assigned,

the main goal of this project was to find a way to use the gotoxy feature from windows, and getch fucntion as well,

at the same time creating a simple space invaders clone. it will perform well on the terminal,

but it might not perform very well on xterm.
