This is a simple score calculation board that decides if there is a winer or a tie between 
the desired input teams, the goal of this project was to demonstrate the usage of 2D dinamic arrays
and to translate c# code into c++ taken from a c# project video i found online,

i even bother adding a validation of numbers only in order to no break the program when a user tries to input
characters into the program
